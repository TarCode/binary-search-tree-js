# Binary Search Tree in JS

This is an implementation and an attempt at learning just what the hell a Binary Search Tree is. 

## This Repo contains:

#### Creating a BST
- Creating a node
- Creating a constructor to instantiate a BST
- A push method to insert values in the correct place in the BST

#### Tree Traversal
- Pre Order
- In Order
- Post Order

- Get min value in tree
- Get max value in tree

### To Run:

`git clone https://github.com/TarCode/binary-search-tree-js`


then:

`node bst.js` 

to see log output of implementations.
